						If you’ve never adopted a pet before, you may be wondering, how does the process work? 
						How long does it take? How much does it cost? 
						The information below will help give you an overview of how it works to adopt a pet from the 
						two main types of organizations: Shelters and Rescues. Each organization is different, 
						but it helps to understand the two main types and what to expect, so you can have a better overall pet adoption experience.

				<div id="content_span4_div">
				
					<span class="text">
						Shelters often have a physical facility, with staff, and operating hours. 
						Some have volunteers and do adoption events around town too. 
						If the pet you see on Adopt-a-Pet.com says that pet is at a Shelter and has an address with business hours, 
						the easiest way to adopt that pet may be to go visit. 
						That’s because some shelters are under-staffed and may not answer all phone calls or emails. 
						Especially if the pet listing says ACT QUICKLY you should go to that shelter ASAP to see that pet!

					<span class="title_grey">Adopting from a Rescue</span>
				</div>
					
				<div id="content_span5_div">
				
					<span class="text">
						Rescues most often have their pets in foster homes or private boarding facilities, and are run by volunteers. 
						They may have adoption events at pet stores on the weekends. 
						If a pet you see on Adopt-a-Pet.com says that pet is at a Rescue, 
						be sure to read the pet description and the Adoption Process under that, and follow each rescue’s instructions. 
						Some prefer you email them first, some prefer you fill out their application before asking about a pet, 
						so they can answer your questions more knowledgeably.

				</div>
				
				<div id="content_span6_div">
				
					<span class="text">
						Please be patient when waiting for a response from a rescue, giving them a few days to respond. 
						Rescue volunteers are people just like you and me, often with very full lives in addition to their rescue volunteering.
